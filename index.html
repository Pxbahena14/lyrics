        <br>[Jay Sean (Nicki Minaj):]
        Oh
        <br>
        (Jay Sean, Jay Sean, Jay Sean)
        <br>
        2-0-1-2 (Nicki Minaj, Nicki Minaj), oh-yeah
        <br>
        It's alright. Oh, it's alright

        <br><b>[Jay Sean:]</b>
        <br>
        You know what they say
        <br>
        Life ain't always easy and every day
        <br>
        We're survivors
        <br>
        So forget the day
        <br>
        It's all about tonight; act a fool and start a riot, a-riot, be a rebel
        <br>
        <div>
            Bottles poppin' 'til we can't stand
           <br>
            We keep it rockin' 'til 6 AM
            <br> 
            New York to London over to Japan
            <br>
            Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
            <br>
            We gonna party like
            <br>
            Party like, like it's the end of the world
            <br>
            We gonna party like, like it's 2012
            <br>
            You know that it doesn't matter as long as we got each other
            <br>Turn it up, turn it up, mash it up
            <br>It ain't the end of the world (Oh)
            <br>Gonna live like it's the end of the world

            <br> <b>[Nicki Minaj:]</b>
            <br>Yo, similes, metaphors, and we pop pills
            <br>Sick flow, inundated with the doc bills
            <br>Work hard, now we know how the top feels
            <br>In the middle of the street doing cartwheels
            <br>Lot of them try to do it, but it's not real
            <br>Wasn't a rapper then I could've got a pop deal
            <br>White curls in a hot pink Hot Wheels
            <br>Lot of bottles and a lot of fruity cocktails
            <br>Uh, days of our lives
            <br>You wink, it goes by
            <br>So we'll just get it with no edits
            <br>Anything goes, so no time for closed minds
            <br>And free my Lil' Weezy
            <br>And let's just get right
            <br>Young money, cash money in the building
            <br>Let's go, the world ends tonight

            <br> <b>[Jay Sean:]</b>
            <br>Have a drink with me
            <br>And let's make tonight go down in history
            <br>In history, yeah
            <br>Let's make believe
            <br>It's the last 24 hours and this whole world is ours
            <br>Eternally, eternally
            <br>
